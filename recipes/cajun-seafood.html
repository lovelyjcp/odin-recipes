        <h1>Cajun Seafood</h1>
        <img src="cajun-seafood.jpg">

        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This must-try Cajun Seafood dish is a duet of shrimp and seashells. At times, seafood becomes a delicacy because it is seasonal, and because it is not exactly readily available for those who live inland and away from the sea, it can get quite pricey. With the increased expenses, seafood dishes are a rare delight for some. But if you are lucky to find some fresh shrimp and seashells, this dish is a sure hit for the entire family or barkada get-togethers.<br>
                With shrimp and mussels added to the pot, you can experience the flavors of the sea in two kinds of textures, making this dish even more interesting. Peel the shrimp and taste the sweetness hidden within, then pull apart the shell of the mussel and chew through the chewy grittiness of its meat.
